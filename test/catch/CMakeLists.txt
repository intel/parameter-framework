" Catch header `catch.hpp' could not be found.
  Catch is a single header unit test framework required to build some tests.
  How to install:
    If it is not available on your package manager, Catch can be downloaded from:
      https://raw.github.com/philsquared/Catch/master/single_include/catch.hpp
    Then either:
      - append the download folder to the `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH' or `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH' variable
      - copy it in a standard location (/usr/include on most linux distribution).
  To remove test dependancies all together, set `BUILD_TESTING' to false.
    It will disable test targets, thus the framework they depend on.")
